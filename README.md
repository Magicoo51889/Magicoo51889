### Hi there 👋
17, pursuing a wide knowledge of anything tech :)

-   I’m currently working on my A-Level CS Project. It's a 2D Space Game using [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), which allows for modern programming practices and faster, better structured development of the game. 
-   I’m currently learning Phaser for my A-Level Project. Additinally I'm learing how to use React to be able to make my own website from scratch.
-   I'm also currently working on the [Greenpower Greencar Project](https://www.greenpower.co.uk/), which has brought me lots of knowledge and experience making and engineering an electric racecar for my school, and having a ton of fun working on it. I'm currently working on making a custom motor controller and ECU for the car, to be able to collect data on track and to be able to have full control over the motor.
